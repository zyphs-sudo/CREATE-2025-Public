# Welcome to the CSS Workshop!

This workshop will walk you through styling the café page we previously built. This time,
there is little starter code but you’ll get more experience playing around with different
attributes.

*Your first task*: Take some time to review the code in the HTML file, and make sure you
understand the way each of the elements work together. If you were unable to complete
the HTML lab, the starter code will be the completed version, including the table of
contents.
 
*Now it's time to code!* Make sure you are now editing the CSS document. We’ll begin by
adding simple edits to this file, and then incorporate classes afterwards (which require
edits to both the HTML files too).

For each section, first create CSS rules for all of the elements below and then modify them
as specified.

*Formatting Fonts and Text:*

*h1* +
- font-family is Sofia +
- color is #8a581c +
- font-size is 50px 

*h2* +
- font-family is Literata +
- color is #402e18
- margin-left is 4rem

*h3* +
- font-family is Sorts Mill Goudy +
- color is #402e18

*p* +
- font-family is Winky Rough +
- color is #402e18

Notice how all the font families were imported in the head of the HTML document! In your
own projects, you would normally have to play around and pick your own colors online
(search “color picker”) as well as your own fonts (search “google fonts”).

*Media and Overall Format:* +
*img* +
- height is 150px
- border-radius is 10% (smooths out the image outline to a rounded rectangle)

*body* +
- background-color is #e8dbb7
- padding is 1rem 6rem (this is a shorthand form to set the padding for the top/bottom and left/right sides respectively)

*.wrap-text* +
- float is left +
- margin-right is 20px

*.pad* +
- padding-bottom is 110px

*Other Elements:* +
*hr* +
- border is 0 +
- height is 1px +
- background is rgb(46, 37, 28)
- margin-top is 3rem

These properties effectively change the color of the hr element by reducing its original
border size and creating a 1px wide line with the given background color.

*Table of Contents:* +
*a:link* +
- color is #41518c 

*a:visited* +
- color is #372f69

*a:hover* +
- color is #0b1847

*a:active* +
- color is rgb(120, 140, 186)

In order, each of these elements control the regular color of the link, the color of the link
once it’s been visited, the color of the link when you hover over it with the cursor, and the
color of the link when it is clicked.

*.contents-pic* +
- margin-left is 25%
- width is 30%
- height is 30%

*li* +
- margin-bottom is 3px

*ol* +
- float is left
- margin-left is 4rem

*Adaptive Behaviour* +
*html* +
- scroll-behaviour is smooth

*@media(max-wdith: 700px)* +
- has another nested .pad class with attribute padding-bottom +
- padding-bottom is 2vw

This last element controls the behaviour of the padding element when the screen size
changes (i.e: if you switch from viewing the site on your laptop to your phone, or if you
change the browser window size)

## END OF CSS DOCUMENT - SWITCH TO HTML DOCUMENT

We’ve finished editing all the elements we have, as well as all the classes for our document.
All that’s left is to implement it in the HTML file.

[begin=2]
. For each div element in the ordered list element (NOT in the table of contents), add
the class “pad”.
. In each image element, add the class "wrap-text".

Congrats! You've just created a café webpage!
